# Vue Mongo API starter

Simple starter with simple routes for posts and users.
It's easily scalable.
To make it work just follow the below instructions:

  - Make sure you have NodeJS and NPM installed - `npm --version` and `node --version` should return the current version (LTS is preffered, but optional)
  - Once the repository is cloned, install all dependencies by typing `npm install`
  - After all is finished run the command `npm run dev` and the server should start
